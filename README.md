# Lab2
COSC 2030 Lab 2
Jacob Williams

Obtained help from Jagadish: something was wrong with a preexisting method, so we commented out the entire thing.

Some explanation behind the makefile:
- First I was just going to compile on the command line (g++), but that seemed hard
- Then it turned out my computer's Visual Studio license had expired, and I didn't feel like learning how to integrate GitHub with VS anyway
- So I decided to learn how to make a Makefile while struggling with the first method
- But then I was able to compile it so I just left the file as-is and compiled from the command line
- The compilation syntax: g++ -o Lab2[.exe] ListProcessor.cpp LinkedList.cpp Node.cpp, which seems to work okay

*tl;dr*: Jagadish helped, and ignore the makefile.
